# Kali Linux Security Lab 🛡️

## Overview
This project documents my hands-on cybersecurity experiments using **Kali Linux** in a **controlled and ethical lab environment**.  
The focus was on understanding password strength, brute-force attacks, and defensive best practices.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**
- **John the Ripper**
- **Hashcat**
- **Aircrack-ng**
- **Wireshark**
- **Metasploit Framework**

## 🧠 Objectives
- Learn password cracking techniques ethically in a lab setup.  
- Understand weaknesses in common password hashing algorithms.  
- Test wireless network security using sample test data.  
- Develop recommendations for password and network hardening.

## 🔐 What I Did
1. Created test users and password hashes in a sandbox system.  
2. Used `John the Ripper` and `Hashcat` to attempt recovery of weak passwords.  
3. Captured and analyzed packets in Wireshark.  
4. Practiced ethical Wi-Fi testing with `aircrack-ng` using my own network.  
5. Documented all methods and mitigation recommendations.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Demonstrated how strong password policies prevent brute-force attacks.  
- Compared cracking times between MD5, SHA1, and bcrypt hashes.  
- Built reports summarizing attack results and security improvements.  

## 🧩 Ethics Note
All tests were conducted **legally and ethically** on lab machines and authorized networks only.  
The goal of this project is **education and cybersecurity awareness**, not malicious hacking.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Automate password audit scripts using Python.  
- Build a simple GUI for password strength testing.  
- Explore advanced encryption (AES, RSA) and key management.
