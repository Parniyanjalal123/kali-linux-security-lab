# Kali Linux Security Lab 🛡️

## Overview
This project documents my hands-on cybersecurity experiments using **Kali Linux** in a **controlled and ethical lab environment**.  
The focus was on understanding password strength, brute-force attacks, and defensive best practices.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**
- **John the Ripper**
- **Hashcat**
- **Aircrack-ng**
- **Wireshark**
- **Metasploit Framework**

## 🧠 Objectives
- Learn password cracking techniques ethically in a lab setup.  
- Understand weaknesses in common password hashing algorithms.  
- Test wireless network security using sample test data.  
- Develop recommendations for password and network hardening.

## 🔐 What I Did
1. Created synthetic test accounts and generated password hashes locally for experimentation.
2. Used Kali toolchain to study how different hash algorithms and password strengths affect recoverability.
3. Compared outcomes across hash types and documented observations (time to recover, success rates)
4. Wrote remediation guidance emphasizing bcrypt/argon2, MFA, and rate limiting.
5. All activities were conducted on local sandbox resources that I created and controlled.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Demonstrated how strong password policies prevent brute-force attacks.  
- Compared cracking times between MD5, SHA1, and bcrypt hashes.  
- Built reports summarizing attack results and security improvements.  

## 🧩 Ethics Note
All tests were conducted **legally and ethically** on lab machines and authorized networks only.  
The goal of this project is **education and cybersecurity awareness**, not malicious hacking.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Automate password audit scripts using Python.  
- Build a simple GUI for password strength testing.  
- Explore advanced encryption (AES, RSA) and key management.
